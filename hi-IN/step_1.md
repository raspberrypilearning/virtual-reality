## You will make

You are going to create a 2.5D scene or what is sometimes called a first person view (FPV) scene. Your game will need to meet the **project brief**.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">2.5D</span> game uses tricks to make a two-dimensional scene have the appearance of being three dimensional.
</p>

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">FPV</span> game mimics a real 3D environment, so that you view the virtual world from the perspective of the playing character in the game.
</p>

You will:
+ Make a 2.5D scene
+ Use `My Blocks`{:class='block3myblocks'} and `clones`{:class='block3events'} to generate the scene
+ Understand how the size and coordinates of a sprite can affect its perspective

### Play ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1">

Try and drive the car. You can speed up and slow down using the pedals on the right. You can change the radio station and the volume of the music. You can even push the horn to warn animals that are crossing the road.

### PROJECT BRIEF: 2.5D simulation
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

You need to create a 2.5D simulation that the user can interact with. The simulation will be from a first person view, so that the user appears to be looking through the screen at the environment you've created.

Your simulation should:
+ Use different sized sprites to represent the distance of the object from the viewer
+ Use clones to generate copies of sprites
+ Use `My Blocks`{:class='block3myblocks'} to keep your code organised and/or allow the use of inputs

Your simulation could:
+ Have an educational theme, to try and teach the user a skill
+ Use sounds or music to make the simulation appear more realistic
