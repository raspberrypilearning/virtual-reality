## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade your project. You might already have ideas about how to add more or you might want to go back to the first step and look at other projects again for more inspiration.

You could:
- Add more sprites to your project
- Add extra sound effects or music
- Change backdrops so that the simulation can switch to different scenes

Each example project in the [Introduction](.) has a **See inside** link for you to open the project in Scratch and look at the code to get ideas and see how they work.
<div class="scratch-preview" style="margin-left: 15px;">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

Take a look at some projects created by community members in the Raspberry Pi Foundationâ€™s studio of Welcome to my world Community Projects [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/30320352){:target="_blank"}.
