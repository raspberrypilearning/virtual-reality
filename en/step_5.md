## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade your project. You might have ideas to add more already or you might want to go back to the first step and look at other projects again for more inspiration.

You could:
- Add more sprites to your project.
- Add extra sound effects or music.
- Change backdrops so that the simulation can switch to different scenes.

Each example project in the [Introduction](.) has a ‘See Inside’ link for you to open the project in Scratch and look at the code to get ideas and see how they work.
