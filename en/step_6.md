Did you meet the **project brief**? Think about your project and go through the checklist below and check off the ones that apply to your project.

Does your simulation:

--- task ---

Use different sized sprites to represent the distance of the object from the viewer.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Use clones to generate copies of sprites.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Use My Blocks to keep your code organised and/or allow the use of inputs.

--- /task ---

Your simulation could also:

--- task ---

Have an educational theme, to try and teach the user a skill.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Use sounds or music to make the simulation appear more realistic.

--- /task ---


Reflecting about how you made your simulation will help you in your future projects:

--- task ---

How did you get your ideas? 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

What cool new thing(s) did you learn?

--- /task ---


A famous inventor called Thomas Edison was very used to making mistakes. He said:
> I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.

and

> Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.

Mistakes and failure are temporary. Keep going until you succeed.

--- task ---

What mistakes did you make and how did they help you create your simulation or make it better?

--- /task ---

### Now you are the author of a Welcome to my world!

Take a moment to celebrate what you have made.

--- task ---

Where will you take your new powers? What will you make next?

--- /task ---
