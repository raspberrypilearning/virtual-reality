## Introduction

You are going to create a 2.5D game or what is sometimes called a first person view (FPV) game. Your game will need to meet the **project brief**.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">2.5D</span> game uses tricks to make a two dimensional scene have the appearance of being three dimensional.
</p>

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">FPV</span> games mimic a real 3D environment, so that you view the virtual world from the perspective of the playing character in the game.
</p>

You will:
+ Make a 2.5D scene
+ Use `My Blocks`{:class='block3myblocks'} and `clones`{:class='block3events'} to generate the scene.
+ Understand how the size and coordinates of a sprite can effect its perspective

### Try it

Try and drive the car. You can speed up and slow down using the pedals on the right. You can change the radio station and the volume of the music. You can even push the horn to warn animals that are crossing the road.

### PROJECT BRIEF: 2.5D simulation
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

You need to create a 2.5D simulation, that the user can interact with. The simulation will be from a First Person View, so that the user appears to be looking through the screen at the environment you've created.

Your simulation should:
+ Use scrolling sprites to give the appearance of movement.
+ Use clones to generate copies of sprites.
+ Use My Blocks to keep your code organised and/or allow the use of inputs.

Your simulation could:
+ Have an educational theme, to try and teach the user a skill.
+ Use sounds or music to make the simulation appear more realistic.
