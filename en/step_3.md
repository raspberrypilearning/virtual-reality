## Build and test

Now it's time to make your simulation. Start with thinking about the background to your simulation. Will it scroll, or will it be static?

**Tip**: Remember to test your project each time you add something. It is much easier to find and fix bugs before you make more changes.

Choose a backdrop to use for your simulation. The backdrop could remain still, or you could make it scroll.

Think about the sprites you will use for your simulation. Will some of them be still in the scene, will they change costumes, effects or motion when they are interacted with? Will they scroll across the screen?

Will any of your sprites need to clone themselves? Will they produce many copies that perform different actions when they start?

Will there be a musical or sound effect aspect to your simulation? Maybe there's back ground noise, or a sprite plays a tune when it is clicked on?

Think about the organisation of your blocks, and the inputs that might be needed. Can you use `myblocks`{:class='block3myblocks'} to **optimise** your project?
